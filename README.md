Periodic
========

Periodic is an educational game for helping K12 students learn chemistry based on the Sifteo platform.

##Building
The project expects to be in the same directory as the Sifteo SDK. (So `periodic` should be immediately in the same folder as `bin`, `examples`, `include`, etc.)

Building can be accomplished using the Sifteo SDK Shell or by building within Visual Studio using the included Visual Studio 2013 solution.

Running in the Siftulator can be accomplished be running `make run` or by starting a debug session in Visual Studio. (Note that Visual Studio debugging features will not actually be available.)

Deploying to hardware currently is only possible by running `make install`, and cannot be accomplished through Visual Studio.
